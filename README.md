# Senza

**Element Framework for PyScript**

## IMPORTANT!
I have broken the orginal project up, so the core senza library is more modular and could be more easily used across frameworks. 
The orginal fastapi starter project is now senza-fastapi. 

This repo meant to run as a (sub)module 

## What is Senza?

senza is a lightweight wrapper around the dom api already offered with pyscript, with a few added features, namely: 
    - more composable ui elements 
    - end-to-end type annotations 
    - a lightweight DOM router, for quickly building page navigation 
    - a more through websocket implementation 

## How to use
At the project root 
__git submodule add https://github.com/Phelsong/senza.git ./senza__ 

(there will be package releases as the project is more throughly fleshed out)
